                    <p>I am insane and imperfect and I must accept that. I hear voices, whispers in the wind, messages from the universe. I have grandiose thoughts that I know about a secret ancient language within the English language. This is called word salad, which is a symptom of schizophrenia.</p>

                    <p>Word salad is a confused or unintelligible mixture of seemingly random words and phrases, specifically as a form of speech indicative of advanced schizophrenia.</p>

                    <p>I am out of my mind, I see things other people do not see. Schizophrenia has changed my life. Hallucinations have flipped my life upside down. I see the unseen and believe I am the Buddha or Jesus or a Shaman. </p>

                    <p>I am paranoid that some people can read my thoughts, and if they can, will they hate me? Will they judge me? I believe I can read other people's thoughts. This is called thought broadcasting.</p>

                    <p>Thought broadcasting is a condition in which people believe that others can hear their thoughts. Some people believe that their thoughts are being broadcasted by the television, radio, or the internet and in some cases people might avoid interacting with these mediums.</p>
